# ORCap-Object-Recognition-Cap-A-navigation-system-for-the-blind-
This project aims to develop a low-cost, portable navigation system for the blind and visually impaired people. We have employed a computer vision based approach to develop ORCap. This system has a simple architecture that can transform the visual information obtained from the IR camera to textual information using Raspberry Pi. This device can easily detect objects of various classes with minimum computation cost. 

ORCap can help in easy path navigation as it is a real-time system and it monitors the environment, providing audio information of objects present. Thus, it offers a safe and secure navigation experience to the user.

Hardware:
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
2. Raspberry Pi NoIR camera 8MP
3. 16 GB SD Card
4. Power bank

The code given here is to be implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.
